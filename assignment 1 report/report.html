    <h1>Assignment 1 report</h1>

    <!-- say something smaller as paragraph text -->
    Path Planning project completed by Yide Gu on Sep. 20.

    <!-- start a new paragraph -->
    <p>
        This is the report for my assignment 1.I have implemented four kinds of ways to realize the automatic path searching for potential robots use.
        The methods includes Depth-first search, Breadth-first, A-star and Greedy Best first algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the following section, I will campare the four methods by setting start point and end point fixed in the same map.

        <h2>The following is a graph for Depth first algorithm: </h2>

    <p>
        <img src="Depth first.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p><p>
        This algorithm used the stack concept, which means "last in first out" to determine the priority.
    </p>


    <h2>The following is a graph for Breadth first algorithm: </h2>

    <p>
        <img src="Breadth first.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p><p>
        This algorithm used the queue concept, which means "first in first out" to determine the priority.
    </p>

    <h2>The following is a graph for A-star algorithm: </h2>

    <p>
        <img src="A-star.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p><p>
        This algorithm combined the first in first out concept with the direct distance to the targer to determine the priority.
    </p>

    <h2>The following is a graph for Greedt Best first algorithm: </h2>

    <p>
        <img src="Greed Best first.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p><p>
        This algorithm only used the direct distance to the targer to determine the priority.
    </p>

    <p>
        The above graphs show that all the four algorithm are successfully implemented.
        Where we can see that Depth first algorithm is relatively fast if compared with Breadth first algorithm.
        However, it gives out a long final path, which is far from expectation. A-star has a better speed than Breadth first search,
        and gives out the shortest path, which is acceptable and should be widely used. The A-star algorithm balanced between the Depth first search and
        the Breadth first search.
        The Greedy best path seems to be quick and short for this case, while by setting another configuration for the map, it could be awful. This will be showed
        in the following section.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting another map configuration to study the behavior of greedy best algorithm: </h2>

    <p>
        <img src="A-star misc.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
        <img src="Greedy Best misc.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p>
    <p>
        In this case, Greedy Best first algorithm still gives out a faster response. However, it gives out a non-ideal path, which is longer than the shortest path obviously.
        The following section will continue to study the performance of the greedy best algorithm by inverting the start and end point.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="A-star misc inverse.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
        <img src="Greedy Best misc inverse.png"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p>
    <p>
        We can see that the postion of the start and end points also have a great influence on the performance. This time greedy best first algorithm
        still have a better behavior over the speed.
    </p>

    <h2>Sum up of the iteration times and path length for all the four methods:</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="sum.PNG"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This sum up table data are collected when the start point is at [0,0] and end point is set at [4,4]. The following one will contain data when the
        start and end points are inverted.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="sum inverse.PNG"
             alt="Breadth first algorithm" />
    </p>
    <p>
        We can see that, besides the above conclusion. The performance of Depth first algorithm is also heavily dependent on the start and end points.
